        <li>Rewarding Memories</li>
        <p> Rewarding Memories is an app for families who would like to provide experiences in a more rewarding and memorable way. This app is intended to build character and gain responsibilities for younger family members, while also trying to break the well-known cycle of “expecting an allowance without having to work for it”.</p>
